#Kode
A small project of my own - an attempt at creating a very simple Java IDE implemented in JavaFX.

##Features
* Simple text editor
* Built in functionality for compiling and running source code
* *Playgrounds*: ability to compile and run source code without saving it first, super handy when you want to try out some code really quick!
